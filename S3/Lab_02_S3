Steps to Host a Static Website on AWS S3

1️.  Create an S3 Bucket

Go to AWS Console → Search for S3 and open it.
Click "Create bucket" (It’s a big orange button).
Give your bucket a unique name (like my-awesome-website).
Select the region closest to your users.
Uncheck "Block all public access" (since we need to make it public).
Click "Create bucket" (boom! your bucket is ready).

2. Upload Your Website Files

Open your bucket → Click "Upload".
Drag and drop your HTML, CSS, JS files (like index.html, style.css).
Click "Upload" (simple, right?).


3. Make your files public
Select your index.html file (or other files you want public).
Click "Actions" → "Make public by ACL" (if available).
Or, go to Permissions → Edit Bucket Policy and paste this:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
Replace your-bucket-name with your actual bucket name.
Click "Save changes
